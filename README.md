This is a really nastily written PHP script I put on my universities servers.
 
It shows what users are sucking up all the resources, as that was a huge problem boxs being deadlocked due to people creating forkbombs or just hogging resources for no good reason.
 
It really took off around campus and people loved it, until I was asked to take it down :(
